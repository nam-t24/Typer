# Typer
Simple typing site that resembles [typings.gg](https://typings.gg)<br />
This is used to develop my skills in javascript along with front-end design and development<br />

### Themes
Pastel and light theme options are incorporated to create an enjoyable experience for the user when learning how to type or testing typing speed<br />
### Quotes API
The site utlizes [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable), made by Luke Peavey, to generate random quotes to use as text

<br />
<br />
*Disclaimer: Not suitable for safari, best used in chrome<br />
*Sadly github recognizes css as the highest used language(due to the fact that there are near identical css pages for themes) :(
